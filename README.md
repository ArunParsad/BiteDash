# Swiggy Clone - Food Delivery Web App

## Overview

This project is a Swiggy Clone, a food delivery web app that aims to replicate the functionality of the popular food delivery platform, Swiggy. The app utilizes the Swiggy public API to fetch restaurant data, menu items, and other relevant information. It is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and incorporates other technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

1. **Browse Restaurants:** Users can browse a list of nearby restaurants available on Swiggy using the public API. Each restaurant displays key information such as ratings, delivery time, and cuisine type.

2. **View Menu and Place Orders:** Once a user selects a restaurant, they can view the restaurant's menu, select items, and add them to their cart. The user can customize their order according to their preferences.

3. **Cart Functionality:** The cart allows users to review their order, adjust quantities, and remove items before proceeding to checkout.

## How to Use the App

Before using the Swiggy Clone web app, you need to install the CORS Chrome extension. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. The Swiggy Clone app needs to fetch data from the Swiggy public API, which may be on a different domain, so the CORS extension is required to allow this cross-origin access.

Follow the steps below to install the CORS Chrome extension:

1. Go to the Chrome Web Store by clicking on the following link: [Allow CORS Access Control Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf/related).

2. Click on the "Add to Chrome" button on the extension page.

3. A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm the installation. Click "Add extension" to proceed with the installation.

4. Once the extension is installed, you should see its icon in the top-right corner of your Chrome browser.

5. The CORS extension should now be active, allowing the Swiggy Clone app to fetch data from the Swiggy public API successfully.

Now you are all set to use the Swiggy Clone app! Simply open the app in your web browser, browse nearby restaurants, view their menus, and place your food orders hassle-free.

Enjoy your food delivery experience with the Swiggy Clone web app!
